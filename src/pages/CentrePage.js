      undefinedHead: `Pressure center and source of inspiration, ideas or anxiety. With an undefined head center, you experience a lack of mental pressure; Be aware of allowing pressure to drive your decisions or feel that something is wrong because you may have an inconsistency with your thoughts or mental will power. You amplify the anxiety or thoughts of those around you. Learn to only focus on the thoughts that are relevant and serve you.
          <br> -	Gifts: You understand that questions are not your own, so you shouldn’t feel the pressure of other’s needs for answers. Being open to new insights and inspiration coming from who is in your aura, you can enjoy the pressure to know more without becoming identified or overwhelmed by it. You tend to withdraw when confused or uncertain.
          <br> -	Traps: You tend to easily feel lost or overwhelmed by doubt that actually belongs to others and end up trying to resolve other people’s questions and take on the worries of those around you, which can lead to you trying to release the mental pressure through action. It’s difficult for you to clear the head’s energy and relax.

      definedHead: `Pressure center and source of inspiration, or anxiety. You may always feel pressure to think but it's important to recognize that you can’t spend your whole life analyzing, you must actually live it: life should be lived, not analyzed. You have the ability to be inspirational to others for their benefit. 
          <br> -	Gifts: You accept mental pressure without needing to turn it into action and you accept confusion, doubt and clarity as natural processes within divine timing. 
          <br> -	Traps: Watch out for turning mental pressure in on itself to be driven deep into anxiety, self-doubt or depression when you feel like you can’t resolve the pressure. Don’t try to resolve pressure through external action, which will lead to hasty or inappropriate decisions (FOLLOW YOUR INNER AUTHORITY!). You may struggle with patience which will mean missed opportunities for inspiration.
